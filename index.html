        My culture consists of who I am, where I came from, I am of Pakistani descent and am Muslim. The Pakistani culture is situated around the predominant religion in Pakistan: Islam. I was born and raised after the tragic event of September 11th, 2001, therefore, I lived my early childhood life not embracing my culture nor admitting that I am Muslim. This was in fear that people would shy away from me or call me terms like ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù. My culture is very important to my family and myself. I was raised in a Pakistani and Muslim household. Even though both my parents are Muslim and Pakistani, my father was born and raised in America and my mother emigrated here after her marriage to my father, my household was not typical to that of a household in Pakistan. My parents were not as strict as other Pakistani parents and were very fair to me during my upbringing. They did, however, still uphold some ideals such as no sleepovers unless it is with family, we practice Islam, we eat Pakistani food and more. However, when I was younger, there was a lot of anti-Muslim propaganda so I did not feel comfortable disclosing to anyone that I was Pakistani and Muslim. As I have grown older, I have gotten more comfortable with my culture and my religion.
My culture empowers me in a few different ways: it has shaped who I am, it has given me an outline of my life, and it has separated me from the rest of the world. I live my culture by practicing Islam in my daily life, with prayers and obeying what the Quran wants in life, along with respecting my family, parents, and elders. There are numerous norms, values, and mental maps that come along with being a part of my culture. These norms are to pray five times a day and to do as you are told. These values are to live life by the Quran and respect your elders. My parents, from a very young age, instilled the value of education and respect. To this day, I always respect my elders, even when I do not feel like it, and study my hardest to make myself and my parents proud. 
Consumerism is something that everybody participates in. Whether it is willing or unwilling, consumerism is a part of everyday life. No matter what your culture is, consumerism is a huge part of that. For instance, there is a long list of things that I do not just want, but need. In that list is my iPhone, my Airpods Pro, my iPad, my laptop, my vast collection of hoodies, my car, my bed, my Xbox, my huge collection of Funko Pops, and my jewelry that I wear daily. My culture has greatly influenced what I buy and what I consider to be my needs. That culture, more specifically, is my American culture more than my Pakistani culture. As an American teenager in today's day and age, it is more than normal to have an iPhone and some form of headphones or earbuds to listen to music.
